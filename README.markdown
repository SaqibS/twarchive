# Twarchive - Archive Your Twitter Updates

This is a simple command line tool which can be run to download your tweets to a file.

For example, running "twarchive saqibs" will download all tweets by me into the file Twarchive.saqibs.txt in your "My Documents" folder. Running the same command again will only download new tweets. Therefore, you could put this command in a Scheduled Task to run every day.
